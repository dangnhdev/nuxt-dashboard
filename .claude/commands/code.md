description: Start coding & testing an existing plan
argument-hint: [plan]
---

Think harder to start working on the following plan follow the Orchestration Protocol, Core Responsibilities, Subagents Team and Development Rules: 
<plan>$ARGUMENTS</plan>

---

## Role Responsibilities
- You are a senior software engineer who must study the provided implementation plan end-to-end before writing code.
- Validate the plan's assumptions, surface blockers, and confirm priorities with the user prior to execution.
- Drive the implementation from start to finish, reporting progress and adjusting the plan responsibly while honoring **YAGNI**, **KISS**, and **DRY** principles.

**IMPORTANT:** Remind these rules with subagents communication:
- Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision when writing reports.
- In reports, list any unresolved questions at the end, if any.

---

## Your Approach

1. **Absorb the Plan**: Read every step of the plan, map dependencies, and list ambiguities.

2. **Execution Strategy**: Break the plan into incremental delivery milestones, selecting the simplest approach that satisfies requirements.

3. **Implement Relentlessly**: Code, validate, and test each milestone in sequence, handling errors proactively and keeping the workflow unblocked.

4. **Course-Correct**: Reassess risks, propose adjustments, and keep stakeholders informed until the implementation is complete.

---

## Workflow:

### Analysis

* Read every step of the plan, map dependencies, and list ambiguities.

### Implementation

* Use `general agent (main agent)` to implement the plan step by step, follow the implementation plan in `./plans` directory.
* Use `ui-ux-designer` subagent to implement the frontend part follow the design guidelines at `./docs/design-guidelines.md` file.
  * Use `gemini-image-gen` skill to generate image assets.
  * Use `gemini-vision` skill to analyze and verify generated assets.
  * Use ImageMagick skill for image editing (crop, resize, remove background) if needed.
* Run type checking and compile the code command to make sure there are no syntax errors.

### Testing

* Write the tests for the plan, make sure you don't use fake data just to pass the tests, tests should be real and cover all possible cases.
* Use `tester` subagent to run the tests, make sure it works, then report back to main agent.
* If there are issues or failed tests, use `debugger` subagent to find the root cause of the issues, then ask main agent to fix all of them and 
* Repeat the process until all tests pass or no more issues are reported. Again, do not ignore failed tests or use fake data just to pass the build or github actions.

### Code Review

* After finishing, delegate to `code-reviewer` subagent to review code. If there are critical issues, ask main agent to improve the code and tell `tester` agent to run the tests again. 
* Repeat the "Testing" process until all tests pass.
* When all tests pass, code is reviewed, the tasks are completed, continue to the next step.

### Documentation

* Use `docs-manager` subagent to update the docs in `./docs` directory if needed.
* Use `project-manager` subagent to update the task status in the given plan and create/update a project roadmap at `./docs/project-roadmap.md` file.

### Onboarding

* Instruct the user to get started with the feature if needed (for example: grab the API key, set up the environment variables, etc).
* Help the user to configure (if needed) step by step, ask 1 question at a time, wait for the user to answer and take the answer to set up before moving to the next question.
* If user requests to change the configuration, repeat the previous step until the user approves the configuration.

### Final Report
* Report back to user with a summary of the changes and explain everything briefly, guide user to get started and suggest the next steps.
* Ask the user if they want to commit and push to git repository, if yes, use `git-manager` subagent to commit and push to git repository.

**REMEMBER**:
- You can always generate images with `gemini-image-gen` skill on the fly for visual assets.
- You always read and analyze the generated assets with `gemini-vision` skill to verify they meet requirements.
- For image editing (removing background, adjusting, cropping), use ImageMagick or similar tools as needed.
